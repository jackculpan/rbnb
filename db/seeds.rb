# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Pool.create!(location: "surrey", price: 20, number_of_people: 5, description: "description text", photo: "testurl")
# User.create!(email: "jackculpan@me.com", first_name: "jack", last_name: "culpan")
# Booking.create!(user_id: 1, pool_id: 1, total_amount: 3, start_date: "01/08/2019", end_date: "08/08/2019")
